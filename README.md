# Ascii-Art
Ascii Art Generator

In main ascii.py file, settings are configurable to tune every image and level of detail. 

The program takes a jpg, converts it to grayscale, and effectively rescales it to the desired output dimensions. 

Configurable variables:
jpg name
Output size
Output characters and what brightness range will map to each character

Note that python is unable to do extended ascii characters but a conversion is easy using find and replace in a text editor.
